You should use the arrow keys to move, if you hit the border of the window the snake will wrap around to the other side. Your goal is to make the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen, for each piece of food you eat you will get one point and the snake will grow, avoid hitting your own body or you'll lose the game. Once you lose a game over screen will pop up with your score.

#### How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake can move up, down, left, or right.
- Try to eat the food that appears on the screen to score points and grow the snake.
- Avoid running into the snake's own body, as this will result in a game over.
- The game has wrap-around edges, meaning the snake can move through one edge of the screen and appear on the opposite edge.

#### Features:

- **Smooth Movement**: The snake moves smoothly at a constant speed.
- **Food and Growth**: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.
- **Game Over Screen**: A game over screen displays the score and provides options to restart or quit the game.
